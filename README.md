The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. The user attempts to guess the word by guessing one letter at a time. The user has 10 chances to guess the word. If the user guess a letter correctly, it appears in the word, if not, the user loses a chance. Also, the program shows a list of letters that the user guessed for reference. If the user figures out the secret word before he runs out of chances, he wins.
